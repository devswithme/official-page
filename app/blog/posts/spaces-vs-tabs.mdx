Recently, I wanted to expand my knowledge by learning more about backend and new programming languages like Go and Rust. Yet, Go has attracted my attention since it is more like a Typescript language where you can define types, and other syntaxes that are similar.

The main difference for me is just the pointer and goroutine concepts which I still don't master it until now to be frank wkwk.

The most important thing when it comes to learning new language is implement it or build projects with it not just theory right? So, I started to migrate my side projects where I implemented Go as a backend that handles authentication, middleware, CRUD, File uploading, caching, etc.

Certainly, it would be safer because all the business logic is handled in the backend while the frontend just focus on the UI (I'm using Shadcn/UI and Tanstack for routing and querying)

So far, I'm quite impressed by the performance and the ease of implementation. Let me know your opinion! ðŸš€
